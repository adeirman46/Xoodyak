# Xoodyak
Xoodyak is lightweight cryptography algortithm. The Algorithm of Xoodyak is simply just hashing message into message digest then do Xoodoo permutation.

## SHA-256
I think this is the easiest SHA-256 Algorithm to understand, don't worry we also made the "step-by-step how to use SHA-256". If you have any questions regarding the algorithm i've made. You can email me @adeirman2705
